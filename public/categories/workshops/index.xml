      <title>Deep Dive Nelson - September</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our September workshop we will be looking at a few tools that help find with
defining and finding new customer segments and other key properties of a
business. We will use that tool to do a few iterations on the Business Model
Canvas to see how our businesses would change given those new properties to
help us unlock new ways to future proof our businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll also look into the Value Proposition Canvas to help us map out how well we
actually address the needs of our customers. This tool is incredibly helpful to
help us make relevant value propositions to our customers that create a high
level of stickiness. Speaking of stickiness - we might talk about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also ditched Eventbrite for now and signups go through Meetup for the time
being, so please sign up to the event there:

      <title>Deep Dive Nelson - August debrief</title>
      <link>http://startup.school.nz/blog/deep_dive_nelson_august_debrief/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had an awesome group of people in the room yesterday and worked through the
general concept of how having a solid understanding and messaging around our
core believes helps to build a loyal customer base. We talked about how to find
and define a &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; for our businesses and how important it is to stick to it. We
talked about a few interesting examples like Apple, Google and Microsoft and
tried to analyse their messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we looked at the Business Model Canvas a bit more and did a
few examples on how to put down an initial idea onto a canvas, then add a
constraint and see how the canvas changes. The examples we used was a small
owner/operator cafe and morphed it into a canvas for Starbucks. We will use the
canvas in future workshops extensively and will use it a lot to explore
alternative business models, how ever alien they may feel. All those mental
exercises will strengthen the creativity in discovering new models and help
find areas in existing businesses that are non-obvious and could lead to a more
resilient business over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone then worked on their own business model canvas and we came up with the
constraint that your primary customer should receive their value proposition
for free. We then worked through the canvas to see how this changed some
aspects on the business but did not touch others. The results were awesome and
I was very excited to see that everyone found an angle how that could actually
work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have put the slides up on speaker deck for those that want to have a look at
them again to remind them on what we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about: &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/norbu09/startup-dot-school-dot-nz-august-slides&#34;&gt;August

      <title>Deep Dive Nelson - August</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first workshop in our series of &lt;em&gt;Deep Dive&lt;/em&gt; workshops is a foundational one
where we explore the Golden Circle and the Business Model Canvas. We will keep
coming back to these so if you plan to invest one day a month to work on your
business in the coming months, then we highly recommend you come around for
this one as these key concepts set you up for a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get some preparation before the workshop I highly recommend watching the following TED talk by Simon Sinek

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop will run on the 7th of August, 10 AM at Innovate (NMIT G Block).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Startup Weekend Nelson 2016</title>
      <link>http://startup.school.nz/blog/startup_weekend_nelson_2016/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Startup Weekend is always a crazy ride of emotions, intensive learning and lack
of sleep. The last Nelson one was no different and it was another incredible
experience for me. I have done more than 20 Startup Weekends by now and one
would think I get used to the awesome energy and enthusiasm but to be honest
every weekend is a new experience and every Startup Weekend I learn a lot from
all the people involved in making this event so awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few new elements we tried out this time around, one was the
greeting part at the very start. At the He Tangata Weekend we had Jeremy Banks
to provide the cultural aspect of the weekend and he started out with everyone
getting a chance to say who they are, where they are from and why they are
here. We took that and were fortunate that Sacha MacDonald explained the idea
to us and started us off to an awesome weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few impressions of the weekend&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pitches were amazing, it always blows me away how the teams progress from
the first 1 minute pitch on Friday, then the first pitch practice on Saturday
night, when most of them are grateful that there is one more day to work out
all those holes they just found in their business, to Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though everyone won lots on this weekend the judges decided that a novel
baby monitor from the NapNanny team was the standout. In fact, they have
already started their kickstarter campaign and plan to launch the device for
real - we will report progress here.&lt;/p&gt;
