We had an awesome group of people in the room yesterday and worked through the
general concept of how having a solid understanding and messaging around our
core believes helps to build a loyal customer base. We talked about how to find
and define a "why" for our businesses and how important it is to stick to it. We
talked about a few interesting examples like Apple, Google and Microsoft and
tried to analyse their messaging.

In the afternoon we looked at the Business Model Canvas a bit more and did a
few examples on how to put down an initial idea onto a canvas, then add a
constraint and see how the canvas changes. The examples we used was a small
owner/operator cafe and morphed it into a canvas for Starbucks. We will use the
canvas in future workshops extensively and will use it a lot to explore
alternative business models, how ever alien they may feel. All those mental
exercises will strengthen the creativity in discovering new models and help
find areas in existing businesses that are non-obvious and could lead to a more
resilient business over time.

Everyone then worked on their own business model canvas and we came up with the
constraint that your primary customer should receive their value proposition
for free. We then worked through the canvas to see how this changed some
aspects on the business but did not touch others. The results were awesome and
I was very excited to see that everyone found an angle how that could actually
work for them.

We have put the slides up on speaker deck for those that want to have a look at
them again to remind them on what we've been talking about: [August
