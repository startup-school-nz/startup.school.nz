The first workshop in our series of _Deep Dive_ workshops is a foundational one
where we explore the Golden Circle, Business Model Canvas and the Value
Proposition Canvas. We will keep coming back to these so if you plan to invest
one day a month to work on your business in the coming months, then we highly
recommend you come around for this one as these key concepts set you up for a
good start.

The workshop will run on the 7th of August, 10 AM at Innovate (NMIT G Block).
