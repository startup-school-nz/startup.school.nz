In our September workshop we will be looking at a few tools that help find with
defining and finding new customer segments and other key properties of a
business. We will use that tool to do a few iterations on the Business Model
Canvas to see how our businesses would change given those new properties to
help us unlock new ways to future proof our businesses.

We'll also look into the Value Proposition Canvas to help us map out how well we
actually address the needs of our customers. This tool is incredibly helpful to
help us make relevant value propositions to our customers that create a high
level of stickiness. Speaking of stickiness - we might talk about that as well.

We also ditched Eventbrite for now and signups go through Meetup for the time
being, so please sign up to the event there:[meetup.com/localfoundation](http://www.meetup.com/localfoundation/events/dghwwlyvmbgb/)
