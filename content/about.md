startup.school.nz started out as a way to run workshops in the Nelson region
that give local founders access to tools, networks and experience. We believe
that building a strong founder fabric needs founders to invest back into that
fabric. We do that by getting experienced founders to run workshops for the
community.

Community trainings are free of charge for the participants as long as they are
owner/operator companies, small teams up to 5 people. To finance this we also
run corporate trainings where we help major companies to get back into the
habit of innovating.
